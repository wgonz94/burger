## What Does the Burger App do?

* It lets the user input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. 
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. 
* When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page-- it will have been devoured.
